# Controlroom Antenna Position Display Software
### by Esteban Struve
This project is part of the participation in AUSAT project of Aarhus University. 
The antenna tracking the satellite in the sky will move with two motors to achieve communication.
The controlroom needs visuals to show this positions to monitor and control the antenna activity.
This project is a simple visual interface for the antenna position over a map of Aarhus.

anglerange.py
Creates two vectors of angle values for Elevation and Azimuth that can be read by the uiantenna.py script.

uiantenna.py
Is the code for the User Interface of the Antenna running on Python v2.7 with Pygame v1.9.3
